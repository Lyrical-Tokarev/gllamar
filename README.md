alpaca motionlessly lies and eats some carrots instead of ryes [yet another hackathon project]

## WTF is this

Here you can find [ODS pet projects](https://ods.ai/projects/pet-projects) community's hackathon project.

The main goal: translate human photos to and from alpacas | llamas and other camelids. Because I love them.

Some or all of the code/interactive parts might be in Russian.

## Our Grand Plan

During the hackathon, which is held at October, 2 - October, 10, 2020 we plan to do:
- collect alpaca | llama | other cutie photos
- annotate them (we'll need bounding boxes with animal faces, since image-to-image translation will work better in this case)
- use magic of CycleGAN (most probably we'll use [this implementation](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN))
- box it: make Telegram bot, mobile application or just demo app with streamlit.

## Project limitations

- we might find not enough alpacas to achieve good results
- two my project members have to work, I have a vacation this week, which I (as usual) spend at home
- tonz of other exciting projects with upcoming deadlines (like [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine)) elsewhere, which are hard to resist, especially when you have 1-week long vacation and admire puzzles
- both of my teammates have no vacations now and have to do their work.
